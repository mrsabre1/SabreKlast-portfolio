# SabreKlast-portfolio
This portfolio site was created to showcase my capabilities developing both front-end and back-end web development.  The intent is to include a resume, a site consuming a RESTful API, a game or two, a Brochure site and an E-commerce site.  Some of the technology includes Bootstrap, React, NodeJS/Express, authentication and usage of MongoDB.
